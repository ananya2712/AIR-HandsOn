<b><i>Completed as a part of Algorithms of the Intelligent Web and Information Retrieval Course - UE19CS332.</b></i>

<b>Assignment 1 & 2 consist of:</b>

1. Uploading Dataset
2. Pre-processing like stemming and lemmatisation
3. Tokenisation and creation of Inverted Index.

<b>Assignment 3 consists of:</b>

1. Creation of Positional Posting List
2. Performing Basic Boolean Query
3. Performing Phrase Query

<b>Assignment 4 consists of:</b>

1. Choose any one of the many parts of this dataset. Each subset has many documents which need to be used in this assignment. 
2. Tokenise each document after preprocessing.
3. Insert tokens into a dictionary built using a binary search tree. 
4. The positional posting list is in the form of a bst. 
5. Posting List/Inverted Index made using hashing function as well.

<b>Assignment 5 consists of:</b>

1. For inverted index created using positional information already built, perform a wild card query using permuterm index and K gram index. 
2. For the 20 News groups dataset, write a word count program using Map reduce. 
3. Use collection frequency as another method.
